## Comparison of DFS and BFS Results

### DFS (Depth-First Search) Paths

DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This can result in longer paths because it goes deep into the graph before considering other branches. Paths found by DFS from "Station A" to "Station G":

- Path 1: ["Station A", "Station C", "Station D", "Station B", "Station G"]
- Path 2: ["Station A", "Station C", "Station D", "Station E", "Station F", "Station G"]
- Path 3: ["Station A", "Station H", "Station G"]
- Path 4: ["Station A", "Station B", "Station G"]
- Path 5: ["Station A", "Station B", "Station D", "Station E", "Station F", "Station G"]

### BFS (Breadth-First Search) Paths

BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This usually results in the shortest path because it considers all possible paths level by level. Paths found by BFS from "Station A" to "Station G":

- Path 1: ["Station A", "Station B", "Station G"]
- Path 2: ["Station A", "Station H", "Station G"]
- Path 3: ["Station A", "Station C", "Station D", "Station B", "Station G"]
- Path 4: ["Station A", "Station B", "Station D", "Station E", "Station F", "Station G"]
- Path 5: ["Station A", "Station C", "Station D", "Station E", "Station F", "Station G"]

### Conclusion

The paths found by DFS are generally longer because DFS goes deep into the graph before backtracking. On the other hand, BFS finds shorter paths because it explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving deeper. In this specific graph, BFS found the shortest paths from "Station A" to "Station G" more efficiently than DFS.
